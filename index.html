        What gets us excited is making products that are used habitually by millions of people; things that last and grow, and become indispensable; that are sustainable not superficial. This is the kind of new stuff we make out of the internet. Why bother? Because products like this create entirely new value instead of simply communicating a companyâ€™s beliefs. Digital offers us new ways to optimise the actual product instead of just 'the communication of the product'.

        We believe - and have proven - that Lean methodologies are effective and efficient ways of achieving these ends: better results, faster - and with far less pain. Our processes are grounded in the ideals of Agile development and design thinking.
        We work unusually closely with client partners, and their customers, to establish a product strategy and develop a customer proposition. Prototyping isn't an intermittent exercise, it's a continuous process: from paper to code, in and out of customers' hands, from week one - and well beyond launch. Make, test, learn, repeat. This is the rhythm of our creative process, driven by real customer feedback rather than ego or guesswork. The product isn't created somewhere down the track, it exists from the beginning.
